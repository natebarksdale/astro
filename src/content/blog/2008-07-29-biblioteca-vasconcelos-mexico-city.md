Although this one (the flagship of the Mexican public library system) looks a
bit like the interior of the Borg spaceships from Star Trek, I'm hard pressed
to find an image of a library that isn't pleasing on some deep level. It's
pleasing to think that the best of library-ness, whatever that quite means,
are promised to be reflected in the cultural furnishings and activity of the
New Jerusalem.
