In the book Andy talks about Fujimura's use of very basic elements--mineral pigments rather than paints, and of course gold leaf--in his paintings, something that echoes the seeming overabundance of natural resources in the Biblical accounts both of Eden and, more glaringly, in the New Jerusalem. Our task as humans is to make something--ideally, something beautiful--from those very basic elements.
